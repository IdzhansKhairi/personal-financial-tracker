## About the Project

**Finttrack** is a personal project born from the need to transform a manual Google Sheets-based financial tracking system into a modern, intuitive web application. This application not only tracks daily income and expenses but also provides powerful data visualization, commitment tracking, wishlist management, and debt tracking capabilities.

The goal is simple: **Take control of your finances with a tool that's accessible anywhere, anytime, and makes financial planning effortless.**

## Problem Statement

<!-- ORIGINAL VERSION - Enhanced below
During my university time, I tend to spend my money without the thoughts of savings, or divide my money so that I have certain amount for me to spend whatever I want and also certain amount for my daily use such as foods and utilities.

However, when I realized how important it is for me to create my own savings and plan my money properly, I started to create my own Google Sheets for me to track the amount of money that I have. Below are the pictures of sheets pages that consist of:
-->

During my university days, I struggled with financial discipline. I would spend money impulsively without considering savings or properly allocating funds for different purposes. After realizing the importance of financial planning, I created a Google Sheets system to track my finances.

### My Google Sheets Journey

Here's what my manual tracking system looked like:

#### 1. Yearly Financial Tracker
![Google Sheets Tracker](media/google_sheets_tracker.png)

<!-- ORIGINAL: This page serves for me to input my incomes or expenses. This page allows me to see the amount of money that I still have for each division. -->
This page allowed me to log all incomes and expenses, showing remaining balances for each financial division.

#### 2. Commitments Tracker
![Google Sheets Commitments](media/google_sheets_commitments.png)

<!-- ORIGINAL: This page serves for me to keep track of my monthly current commitments that I need to pay. Hence I just take note if I already make the payment for that particular month or not yet. I also can list the commitments that I have so I can see the total monthly amount and yearly amount. Other than that, I also be able to take not if I have future commitments in plan. -->
A dedicated space to track monthly recurring payments and commitments, noting payment status and calculating total monthly/yearly obligations.

#### 3. Salary Division System
![Google Sheets Salary Division](media/google_sheets_salaryDivision.png)

<!-- ORIGINAL: This page serves for me to put the amount of income that I get for me to directly divide it into a few franctions. Here is how the division works: -->
My financial philosophy revolves around dividing income into four categories:

| Division | Percentage | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Past** | 30% | Monthly commitments and bills |
| **Present** | 40% | Daily living expenses (food, transport, utilities) |
| **Future** | 20% | Savings and investments |
| **Bliss** | 10% | Personal enjoyment and hobbies |


#### 4. Hobby Expenses Tracker
![Google Sheets Gundam Expenses](media/google_sheets_gundamExpenses.png)

<!-- ORIGINAL: This part of sheets is just for me to track the amount of money I spent every month on Gunplas. -->
Tracking specific hobby spending (in my case, Gunpla models) to understand how much I invest in my passions.

#### 5. Wishlist
![Google Sheets Wishlist](media/google_sheets_wishlist.png)

<!-- ORIGINAL: This part of sheets is for me to jot down on the items that is in my wishlist such as the name of the items and also the estimated price and maybe the link to the items itself. -->
A simple list to jot down desired items with estimated prices and links.

### The Problem

<!-- ORIGINAL: This method works just fine. However, I have some problem on the data visualization and the UI visualization itself of the Google Sheets for me to use it in my daily life. It might not be nice for other people to look on it at the first glance. -->

While Google Sheets worked, it had limitations:
- **Poor data visualization** - Difficult to see spending trends at a glance
- **Not mobile-friendly** - Clunky to use on phones
- **Manual data entry** - No automation or smart categorization
- **Limited interactivity** - Can't easily filter, search, or analyze data
- **Lacks polish** - Not visually appealing or intuitive for daily use

---

## Features

# Self Learning Section

## Project Creation Section
To create a project do as such:

#### Step 1: Install Node.js:
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the LTS version (recommended for stability)
3. Install it like any regular Windows app
4. After installation, open CMD and run:
```cmd
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Step 2: Create a New Next.js App
1. Open VSCode
2. Open a terminal in VSCode (Ctrl + ~)
3. Run this command to create a new Next.js project:
```cmd
npm create-next-app@latest <app-name>
```

#### Step 3: Navigate and Run Your App
```cmd
cd <app-name>
npm run dev
```

## Extra CSS Usage 
To use a bootstrap, `npm install bootstrap` and import it inside the `layout.tsx` as such:
```tsx
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import './globals.css'; // your own style
```

To use Ant Design, do as such:
```cmd
npm install antd
```
```tsx
import 'antd/dist/reset.css'; 
```

To use Bootstrap Icon:
```cmd
npm install bootstrap-icons
```
```tsx
import 'bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css';
```

To use SweetAlert2:
- SweetAlert2 works in plain JS, but you can use React wrapper for easier integration:
```cmd
npm install sweetalert2
npm install @sweetalert2/theme-bootstrap-4
```
```tsx
import Swal from 'sweetalert2';
import '@sweetalert2/theme-bootstrap-4/bootstrap-4.min.css';
```

## Push project to github
1. Create a github repo at https://github.com
2. Open terminal and change directory to ur project.
3. Then:
```cmd
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

4. Pushing using HTTPS (quick, simplest)
Add the remote and push:
```cmd
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/my-project.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Keycloak usage:
Start a new persistent keycloack container in docker:
```cmd
docker run -d --name nextjs_keycloak ^
  -p 8080:8080 ^
  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin ^
  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin ^
  -v keycloak-data:/opt/keycloak/data ^
  quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:21.1.1 ^
  start-dev
```

Later you can restart it with:
```cmd
docker start keycloak   :: next day start
docker stop keycloak    :: stop when you’re done
docker logs -f keycloak :: see logs if needed

```

In the Keycloak portal, in the client, set:
Valid redirect URIs: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/keycloak

Web origins: http://localhost:3000

And then go back to the created client, add predefined mappers:
`realm roles`

```
You need to configure Keycloak to include roles in the token. Do this:

In Keycloak Admin Console, go to your client:
    Clients → Your Client → Client Scopes tab
    Click on <client-id>-dedicated (or the default scope)

Add "roles" mapper to the scope:
